    "Watson NLP offers so-called blocks for various NLP tasks. This notebook shows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Syntax analysis** with the _Syntax block_ for English (`syntax_izumo_en_stock`). This block performs tokenization, lemmatization, parts of speech tagging, and dependency parsing on raw input documents so that custom models can properly classify documents.\n",
    "- **Emotion classification** with the _Ensemble emotion workflow_ (`ensemble_classification-wf_en_emotion-stock`) and the _Aggregated emotion workflow_ (`aggregated_classification-wf_en_emotion-stock`). These model workflow classify text into five emotions: \"sadness\", \"joy\", \"anger\", \"fear\", \"disgust\".\n",
